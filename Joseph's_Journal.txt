Jacob and I formed our battleship group

2/8/19 - 1 hour
We hashed out what we wanted to acheive in our game and ranked them with difficulty levels

2/14/19 - 38 minutes
We watched a video and made a grid in unity

2/14/19 - 1 hour and 22 minutes
We worked on make five ship objects and making it so that they would stay within the 10 by 10 grid

2/21/19 - 1 hour and 10 minutes
I tried figuring out colors and how to use and change them

2/21/19 - 1 hour and 30 minutes
We tried building off of what we were doing before and decided that it wasn't fessible so we stopped and started something new that will hopefully work out better.

2/21/19 - 1 hour
Messing with buttons to try and get some things done

2/21/19 - 1 hour
Still messing with the buttons, trying to get it to change colors on mouse click. No luck

2/22/19 - 1 hour and 5 minutes
Made 98 buttons and made it so they turn white when you push them

2/22/19 - 1 hour and 7 minutes
We finally got the buttons to change to the colors that we want them to change. The future is ahead of us.

2/25/19 - 1 hour and 16 minutes
I added some text for a score board and some insults to be spawned when people miss too much and the game drags on

2/26/19 - 1 hour and 8 minutes
We worked on connecting all the buttons to the game board so that we could put ships in them and then work on rotating them but that really amout to anything yet. Then we worked on the slides for the presentation

2/27/19 - 30 minutes
I just moved some stuff around so the unity project arrows don't seem so cluttered and tried some stuff with the board loops that grab the buttons that didn't end up doing anything so its the same as before
